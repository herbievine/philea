### How to setup your project

We have a live site at `https://philea.io`, but you can also follow along to locally install Philea:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/herbievine/philea.git
cd philea
npm i # or yarn
npm run dev # or yarn dev
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000` and it should be un and running!

### Project Submission

- Provide an explanation of the features of your projects. You must link a demonstration video with commentary and screen recording of your presentation (10 slides max) or demo product (example: Loom, 4 minutes max).
- Include a brief demonstration of the use of Starton or its partners iExec, BNB Chain, NodeReal, or Ledger.
The more you use partner technologies, the more points you will earn. Example: Use the Starton API on the BNB Chain blockchain.
